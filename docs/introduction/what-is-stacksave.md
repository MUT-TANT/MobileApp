# What is StackSave?

StackSave is a decentralized savings application that bridges traditional financial goal-setting with blockchain technology. Built with Flutter, it provides a seamless mobile experience for users who want to manage their savings using cryptocurrency wallets.

## The Problem We Solve

Traditional savings apps often lack:
- True ownership of funds (custodial solutions)
- Transparency in how money is managed
- Integration with modern crypto wallets
- Cross-platform accessibility

StackSave addresses these challenges by:
- Giving users complete control through non-custodial wallet connections
- Leveraging blockchain transparency for all transactions
- Supporting WalletConnect V2 for broad wallet compatibility
- Providing a beautiful, native mobile experience

## Core Philosophy

### Self-Custody
Your keys, your crypto, your savings. StackSave never holds your funds - you maintain complete control through your own wallet.

### Transparency
All transactions and savings are recorded on-chain, providing complete transparency and auditability.

### Simplicity
Web3 technology can be complex, but saving money shouldn't be. StackSave provides an intuitive interface that makes crypto savings accessible to everyone.

### Privacy
Your financial goals are personal. StackSave stores your goal data locally and only interacts with the blockchain for actual transactions.
